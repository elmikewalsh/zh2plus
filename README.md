ZH2+ WP Theme - An Updated &amp; Enhanced Remake of the Zenhabits Website

<strong>Languages:</strong> English, Espa√±ol

<p>The <a href="http://zenhabits.net/theme/" target="_blank">original version</a> of this theme was created by <a href="http://leobabauta.com" target="_blank">Leo Babauta</a> and is the theme currently used on the famous <a href="http://zenhabits.net" target="_blank">zenhabits</a> website. This is an updated version of the zh2 theme.</p>

<p>This updated and enhanced version builds upon the revised <a title="ZH2 Updated: WP Theme" href="https://github.com/imaginalgo/zh2-updated" target="_blank">ZH2 Updated</a> theme. In addition to the simplified installation process, there are also several additional, extra features, for those who want a minimalist blog, but feel that certain elements are&#8230; missing. New features include:</p><ul><li><strong>Header Navigation:</strong> Turn on/off a new header navigation option.</li><li><strong>Color Chooser:</strong> You can now choose colors for the background, font, headers, link and more from the Theme Customizer.</li><li><strong>Back to Top:</strong> Have a long post? Turn on the new Back to Top link in the footer and visitors can return to the top instantly.</li><li><strong>Google Analytics:</strong> All you need is your Google Analytics ID and you are set to track visitors.</li></ul>

<strong>Note:</strong> This is an old WordPress theme. I neither promise nor provide any support.
